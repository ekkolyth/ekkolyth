# 👋 Hey, I'm Mike Kenway

Developer / Designer

## 💻 What I Do

I'm a full-stack creative working at the intersection of **design, code, and storytelling**. My background spans a decade of hands-on experience in:

- 🎨 **UX/UI Design** — thoughtful, user-centered interfaces that aren’t just pretty, but purposeful.
- 🧑‍💻 **Front-End Development** — currently working with **Next.js**, **React**, **TypeScript**, and slowly mastering **Tailwind CSS** (yes, I’ve surrendered).
- 🧵 **Back-End Dev** — building with **Node.js**, **PostgreSQL**, **Supabase**, **Prisma**, and **Docker** for self-hosted environments.
- 🛠️ **Infra & IT** — running a home lab with **CasaOS**, **NGINX**, **Linux servers**, and way too many Docker containers.
- 🧠 **Creative Direction** — from branding and product design to Shopify store strategy and campaign rollouts.

## 🛠️ What I'm Building

### ⚡️ [PageFlow.co](https://pageflow.co)
A drag-and-drop **link page builder** for creators and small teams. Think Linktree, but with real creative control (custom CSS, staging previews, and team workflows included).

### 🎮 [ApexFoundry.gg](https://apexfoundry.gg)
A personal playground project to sharpen my front-end skills. Random legend/squad generator, filtering, tier lists, and more — all built in **Next.js** using a live **Supabase** backend.

### 🧰 Personal Dev Toolbox
Custom utilities, Notion automations, home server setup scripts, and full-service dockerized apps for self-hosted media, book libraries, and game servers (Palworld, Minecraft, Astroneer).
