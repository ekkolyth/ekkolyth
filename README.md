## 💻 What I Do

I'm a full-stack creative living at the intersection of **design, code, and storytelling**. My background spans over a decade of hands-on experience in:

- Tanstack Start/Router (React)
- Next.js (React)
- TypeScript
- Convex
- Drizzle

&& whatever else has my fancy that day (as i'm typing this, it's electron. I just made a TSRouter/Electron starter - [check it out!](https://github.com/mikekenway/electron-tanstack-starter))

- 🛠️ **Infra & IT** — keeping my clients operating at the speed of Windows Server 2016. Experience with:
- Server Administration (Linux / Windows / Mac)
- Linux Admin

# 🛠️ What I'm Building

## [miso](https://misojs.dev/)

#### `  Go  `

A DX Tool for Typescript (and I guess Javascript) developers. Never worry about remembering which package manager you're supposed to be using ever again (and some other fun stuff, too!)

## [ghostbot](https://github.com/ekkolyth/ghostbot)

#### `  Tanstack Start  |  Typescript  |  Go  |  Better Auth  |  Drizzle  |  SQLC  |  Postgres  `

My latest obsession. I've been teaching myself backend by developing this discord bot for my server. The Bot runs on a custom API I'm building from scratch in Go.

## [create-ekko-app](https://github.com/ekkolyth/create-ekko-app)

#### `  Go | Deno  `

Another small cli i maintain to make it easy to spin up apps with my favorite web stack. Initially written in Deno, but ported to Go.

### More Stuff ~

[ApexFoundry.gg](https://apexfoundry.gg) - A Playground for Apex Legends Players.

[ek(klip)se](https://github.com/ekkolyth/ekklipse) - A simple pastebin for sharing between friends/devices.

[Ekko Playlist](https://github.com/ekkolyth/ekko-playlist) - YouTube Playlist Management

[EkkoUI](https://github.com/ekkolyth/ui) - A personal UI Library I'm working on to share between the apps I maintain. Building some cool theming tools I'm hoping to share soon!

[Next JS/Redis Starter](https://github.com/ekkolyth/nextjs-bun-redis-convex-turborepo-starter) - Exploring replacing the built in caching from Next with Redis.
