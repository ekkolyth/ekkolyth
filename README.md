# 👋 Hey, I'm Ekko

UX Developer / Designer

## 💻 What I Do

I'm a full-stack creative living at the intersection of **design, code, and storytelling**. My background spans over a decade of hands-on experience in:

- 🎨 **UX/UI Design** — thoughtful, user-centered interfaces that aren’t just pretty, but purposeful.
- 🧑‍💻 **Front-End Development** — currently working with **Next.js**, **React**, **TypeScript**,  Tanstack Router, Go, Convex, Drizzle, && whatever else has my fancy that day (as i'm typing this, it's electron. I just made a TSRouter/Electron starter - [check it out!](https://github.com/mikekenway/electron-tanstack-starter)).
- 🛠️ **Infra & IT** — the boring stuff. windows/linux admin, networking, and running my own little Docker homelab.

## 🛠️ What I'm Building

### [ApexFoundry.gg](https://apexfoundry.gg)
```
Next.js  |  Typescript  |  Convex
```
A Playground for Apex Legends Players.

### [ek(klip)se](https://github.com/ekkolyth/ekklipse)
```
Tanstack Start  |  Typescript  |  Convex
```
A simple pastebin for dropping between friends/devices.

### [ekko-bot](https://github.com/ekkolyth/ekko-bot)
```
Tanstack Start  |  Typescript  |  Go  |  Better Auth  |  Drizzle  |  SQLC  |  Postgres
```
My latest obsession. I've been teaching myself backend by developing this discord bot for my server. The Bot runs on a custom API I'm building from scratch in Go.

### [create-ekko-app](https://github.com/ekkolyth/create-ekko-app)
```
Deno  |  Typescript
```
A silly side project i maintain to make it easy to spin up apps with my favorite web stack. Deno is really cool, and I think there's definitely a place for it in the future of javascript.

### EkkoOS
Next.js, Clerk, Convex, Docker - My personal productivity system app - alongside a docker network with 40+ containers.
