# 👋 Hey, I'm Mike Kenway

Developer / Designer

## 💻 What I Do

I'm a full-stack creative working at the intersection of **design, code, and storytelling**. My background spans a decade of hands-on experience in:

- 🎨 **UX/UI Design** — thoughtful, user-centered interfaces that aren’t just pretty, but purposeful.
- 🧑‍💻 **Front-End Development** — currently working with **Next.js**, **React**, **TypeScript**, and slowly mastering **Tailwind CSS**.
**Supabase**, **Prisma**, and **Docker** for self-hosted environments.
- 🛠️ **Infra & IT** — running a home lab with **CasaOS**, **NGINX**, and way too many Docker containers.

## 🛠️ What I'm Building

### [PageFlow.co](https://pageflow.co)
A drag-and-drop **link page builder** for creators and small teams. Think Linktree, but with real creative control (custom CSS, staging previews, and team workflows included).

### [ApexFoundry.gg](https://apexfoundry.gg)
A personal playground project to sharpen my front-end skills. Random legend/squad generator, filtering, tier lists, and more — all built in **Next.js**.

### Personal Dev Toolbox
Custom utilities, Notion automations, home server setup scripts, and full-service dockerized apps for self-hosted media, book libraries, and game servers (Palworld, Minecraft, Astroneer,etc).
