# 🛠️ What I'm Building

## [miso](https://misojs.dev/)

#### `  Go | Lipgloss (by Charm Bracelet)  `

A DX Tool for Typescript (and I guess Javascript) developers. Never worry about remembering which package manager you're supposed to be using ever again (and some other fun stuff, too!)

## [ghostbot](https://github.com/ekkolyth/ghostbot)

#### `  Tanstack Start  |  Typescript  |  Go  |  Better Auth  |  Drizzle  |  SQLC  |  Postgres  `

My latest obsession. I've been teaching myself backend by developing this discord bot for my server. The Bot runs on a custom API I'm building from scratch in Go.

## [create-ekko-app](https://github.com/ekkolyth/create-ekko-app)

#### `  Go | Deno  `

Another small cli i maintain to make it easy to spin up apps with my favorite web stack. Initially written in Deno, but ported to Go.

### More Stuff ~

[EkkoUI](https://github.com/ekkolyth/ui) - `  Typescript | React  ` - A personal UI Library I'm working on to share between the apps I maintain. Building some cool theming tools I'm hoping to share soon!
